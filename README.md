## Project Overview
This analysis aims to provide insights on the demands and sales of drug products in the Lagos Drug open market; Idumota. By collecting and analyzing data from the weekly activities of different wholesale Outlets in the market, we seek to uncover insights and patterns based on the highest and lowest products in demand together with the products with the highest and lowest revenues. This analysis will give stakeholders the tools and knowledge to make informed decisions based on the data provided.

## Data Sources
This Data was collected manually from 11 major Outlets in Idumota. The Outlets are presumed to be the most performing ones out of over 3000 outlets. 

## Tools
1.	Excel (Used for data entry, data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data preparation for Visualization).
2.	Tableau (Used for Data Visualization).

## Data Collection and Preparation
In the collection process the following data was collected;
1.	Name of Outlet.
2.	Name of product.
3.	Unit price of product.
4.	Consumption rate per week.
5.	Manufacturing country.
6.	Marketer or Company
In the preparation process, Data was entered, cross checked and cleaned.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
This involves exploring the data to answer key questions such as;
1.	What are the highest and lowest selling products?
2.	What are the most demanded and least demanded product categories?
3.	What is the most demanded product?
4.	What is the weekly percentage demand by category?

## Key Point Indicators (KPIs)
Some important Key point indicators to note are as follows;
1.	Number of Outlets: Data was collected from a total of 11 Outlets.
2.	Number of Products: A total number of 45 products were recorded.
3.	Average sales by Availability: Prescription Only Medicines (POM) have an average weekly sale of 1,068,313 .00 naira and Over the Counter (OTC) Medications have an average weekly sale of 845,767.00 naira.
4.	Number of Manufacturing Countries: A total of 12 countries were recorded

## Results and Findings
### 1.	Average Weekly sales by Category
Injections have the highest weekly average sales of 1.2-million-naira, surpassing Creams by 30,000 naira. It has a significantly higher revenue compared to other categories. Gummies have the lowest weekly average sales.
### Recommendations
Stakeholders should consider injection as a potential investment but keep in mind its demand is not nearly as high due to storage, usage and availability. Due to the route of administration, it is usually only demanded by hospitals, pharmacies and practicing professionals.

### 2.	Top 10 highest Selling Products
This list can be used to determine the top selling products. Amatem softgel 40/480, an antimalarial medication containing Artemether and Lumefantrine, is the top selling product with a total revenue of 3.4 million naira. The least selling product is Teva Lincomycin with a weekly revenue of 51000 naira.
### Recommendation
Stakeholders can consider investing in the production of own brands of mentioned products as these products have significantly higher revenues.

### 3.	Top 10 Most Demanded Products
Amatem softgel is the most demanded product in the market and Cyprivite is the least demanded.
### Recommendation
High demand does not always lead to high revenue. Depending on the goals of the stakeholders, this strategy can be used to increase popularity of the product.

### 4.	Percentage Weekly Percentage/Demand
Tablets have a percentage weekly demand value of 67.84% surpassing the total of all the other categories. Powder has a value of 0.54% making it significantly the least demanded category.
### Recommendation
Investments in tablets is the most reliable due to the ease of administration, easy/minimal storage conditions, low cost of production and longer shelf lives. 

## Limitations
Due to the poor Data Culture and disorganization of the market, data collection was tedious and sometimes lead to collection of incorrect and unreliable data.
